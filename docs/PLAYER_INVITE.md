# Player invites

How league owners invite players and how the mobile app must wire signup, profile creation, and roster joining. See [ROUTES.md](../ROUTES.md) for full request/response shapes and [MANAGE_LEAGUE.md](./MANAGE_LEAGUE.md) for the admin Players tab.

**Related:** [MOBILE_AUTH_ROUTES.md](../MOBILE_AUTH_ROUTES.md) — signup/login tokens.

## Core rules

1. A **player profile** cannot exist without a **user account**.
2. Admins **cannot** manually create players — they generate invite links only.
3. The **user** creates their own player profile (display name, country, optional bio, optional avatar) during invite acceptance.
4. **`POST /api/v1/auth/signup` does not join a league.** Signup only creates a `users` row and returns a Bearer token. The app must call the invite accept endpoints afterward.

---

## Flow A — Admin invites a specific user

1. Admin searches: `GET /api/v1/auth/users/search?q=&leagueId=`
2. Admin picks user, season, team → generates link with `invitedUserId`
3. System stores invite: `token` + `leagueId` + `seasonId` + `teamId` + `invitedUserId`
4. Admin shares link with that user
5. User opens link → signs up or logs in
6. App calls accept endpoints (see [Invitee app flow](#invitee-app-flow-react-native))
7. If no player profile yet → profile form → then roster join
8. Done: `players` row + `league_players` row; invite marked `accepted`

Only the user whose `id` matches `invitedUserId` can accept. Anyone else gets `403`.

---

## Flow B — General invite link

Same as Flow A, but **omit** `invitedUserId` when generating the link. Anyone authenticated can accept (first successful accept consumes the token — see [Single-use tokens](#single-use-tokens)).

1. Admin picks season + team → `GET /api/v1/invites/generate?leagueId=&seasonId=&teamId=`
2. Admin shares link (WhatsApp, SMS, etc.)
3. Invitee flow is identical to Flow A from step 5 onward

## What signup does vs what the invite APIs do

| Step | API | Creates user? | Creates player? | Joins league? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sign up | `POST /api/v1/auth/signup` | Yes | No | No |
| Log in | `POST /api/v1/auth/login` | — | No | No |
| Accept (has profile) | `GET /api/v1/invites/accept/:token` | — | No | **Yes** |
| Accept (no profile) | `GET /api/v1/invites/accept/:token` | — | No | No — returns `requiresProfile: true` |
| Complete profile + accept | `POST /api/v1/invites/complete-profile-and-accept/:token` | — | **Yes** | **Yes** |

**New user path:** signup → accept (profile required) → profile screen → complete-profile-and-accept → navigate to league.

**Returning user path:** login → accept → immediately joined → navigate to `leagueId`.

There is no separate “confirm invite” API. Joining is automatic once accept (or complete-profile-and-accept) succeeds.

---

## Invites table (backend)

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `token` | UUID in the shareable link |
| `league_id`, `season_id`, `team_id` | Roster placement on accept |
| `invited_user_id` | Flow A: required user. Flow B: `null` |
| `status` | `pending` → `accepted` (or `expired`) |
| `expires_at` | 7 days from generation |
| `accepted_at` | Set when consumed |

The `invites` row is **not** a player record. It is a one-time ticket that drives `players` + `league_players` creation on accept.

## Admin app flow (Manage → Players tab)

Bearer token on all routes. User must own the league (`leagueOwner` middleware).

### Flow A — invite someone specific

1. Load teams: `GET /api/v1/auth/users/leagues/:leagueId/teams`
2. Search users: `GET /api/v1/auth/users/search?q={query}&leagueId={leagueId}`
3. Generate link:
   ```
   GET /api/v1/invites/generate?leagueId=&seasonId=&teamId=&invitedUserId={userId}
   ```
4. Response (not wrapped in `data`):
   ```json
   { "inviteLink": "https://join.sportykore.com/join/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" }
   ```
   `inviteLink` is an absolute public page URL (`PUBLIC_WEB_URL`, else `APP_URL`). Share it as-is. For the native app, extract the token from the path (`/join/{token}`) and open `sportykore://join-league?token=...`.
5. Native share sheet (WhatsApp, SMS, etc.)
6. Refetch roster after invitees accept: `GET /api/v1/leagues/:leagueId/seasons/:seasonId/roster`

### Flow B — general link

Same as Flow A, but **do not** send `invitedUserId`:

```
GET /api/v1/invites/generate?leagueId=&seasonId=&teamId=
```

### Roster management (after players join)

| Action | API |
| --- | --- |
| List roster | `GET /api/v1/leagues/:leagueId/seasons/:seasonId/roster` |
| Edit jersey, position, captain, status | `PUT /api/v1/leagues/league-players/:id` |
| Remove | `DELETE /api/v1/leagues/league-players/:id` |

## Invitee app flow (React Native)

This section is **required** for invites to work. If the app only signs the user up and never calls accept, they will have an account but **no player profile and no league**.

### 1. Deep link handling

Register a route for `/join/:token` (or equivalent universal link).

On open:

- Extract `token` from the URL
- Persist it until accept completes (e.g. AsyncStorage key `pendingInviteToken` **and** in-memory nav state)
- Do **not** discard the token after signup — signup does not consume the invite

Prefix for sharing: the generate API already returns a full `https://join.sportykore.com/join/{token}` URL when `PUBLIC_WEB_URL` is set. Do not prepend `APP_URL` or `MOBILE_APP_URL`.

### 2. Auth gate

If no Bearer token → show signup or login ([MOBILE_AUTH_ROUTES.md](../MOBILE_AUTH_ROUTES.md)).

After successful signup/login, **immediately** continue to step 3 (do not send the user to the home screen without processing the invite).

### 3. Accept invite

```
GET /api/v1/invites/accept/:token
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Send the Bearer token on every call. The route uses `getUserOrFail()` — unauthenticated requests fail.

**Responses:**

| Case | Response | App action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New user (no player profile) | `{ "requiresProfile": true, "token": "..." }` | Go to step 4 |
| Existing user with profile | `{ "requiresProfile": false, "leagueId": 10 }` | Clear stored token; navigate to league `10` |
| Flow A, wrong account | `403` | Show “This invite is for another account” |
| Already on roster | `409` | Show message; clear token |
| Invalid / expired token | `404` | Show “Invite expired or invalid”; clear token |

### 4. Create player profile (new users only)

Show a screen collecting **display name** (`name`) and **country** (`countryId` from `GET /api/v1/countries`). Optional `bio` and **avatar** image.

On submit (`multipart/form-data` when including an avatar):

```
POST /api/v1/invites/complete-profile-and-accept/:token
Authorization: Bearer <token>

name=Alex Morgan
countryId=1
bio=...
avatar=<file>   # optional; jpg/jpeg/png/webp, max 2 MB
```

JSON without an avatar is also valid: `{ "name": "Alex Morgan", "countryId": 1, "bio": "..." }`.

**Response:**

```json
{ "leagueId": 10 }
```

Then:

- Clear `pendingInviteToken` from storage
- Navigate to the league (use `leagueId`; there is no `GET /auth/users/me` player/leagues payload today)

### 5. Cold start with stored token

If the user already logged in but quit mid-flow (e.g. after signup, before profile form):

- On app launch, if `pendingInviteToken` exists → resume at step 3
- There is **no** `GET /invites/mine` endpoint today; token recovery depends on client persistence

For Flow A only, a future `GET /invites/mine` (pending rows where `invited_user_id = auth user`) could recover invites without the token — not implemented yet.

### 6. Optional UX (no extra APIs)

- **Preview before signup:** show league/team context from admin copy or a future preview endpoint — not required for accept to work
- **Confirmation screen:** “Join Riverside United?” can gate step 3/4; the same accept APIs run on Continue

## API reference

| Step | Method | Path | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Search users (Flow A) | `GET` | `/api/v1/auth/users/search?q=&leagueId=` | `apiAuth` + must own `leagueId` |
| Teams picker (admin) | `GET` | `/api/v1/auth/users/leagues/:leagueId/teams` | `apiAuth` |
| Generate invite link | `GET` | `/api/v1/invites/generate?leagueId=&seasonId=&teamId=&invitedUserId?` | `apiAuth` + `leagueOwner` |
| Accept invite | `GET` | `/api/v1/invites/accept/:token` | Authenticated user (Bearer) |
| Complete profile + accept | `POST` | `/api/v1/invites/complete-profile-and-accept/:token` | `apiAuth` |
| List season roster | `GET` | `/api/v1/leagues/:leagueId/seasons/:seasonId/roster` | `apiAuth` + `leagueOwner` |
| Update roster row | `PUT` | `/api/v1/leagues/league-players/:id` | `apiAuth` + `leagueOwner` |
| Remove from roster | `DELETE` | `/api/v1/leagues/league-players/:id` | `apiAuth` + `leagueOwner` |

`invitedUserId` is for Flow A only (omit for Flow B). `teamId` is required when generating from the Players tab.

Auth routes used by invitees: `POST /api/v1/auth/signup`, `POST /api/v1/auth/login` — see [MOBILE_AUTH_ROUTES.md](../MOBILE_AUTH_ROUTES.md).

## Error handling (invitee)

| HTTP | Cause | UX |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `401` | Missing/expired Bearer token | Redirect to login; keep stored invite token |
| `403` | Flow A invite for a different user | Explain wrong account; offer logout |
| `404` | Bad token or expired invite | Clear stored token; show not found |
| `409` | Already on roster / profile exists on complete | Show server message; clear token if already joined |

---

## Flow A vs Flow B

| | Flow A | Flow B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generate | Include `invitedUserId` | Omit `invitedUserId` |
| Who can accept | Only that user id | Any authenticated user |
| Wrong account | `403` | N/A |
| Token recovery without link | Possible with future `invites/mine` | Client must keep token |

---

## Single-use tokens

Each successful accept sets `status: accepted`. The same link cannot be used again. For Flow B links shared in group chats, only the **first** person to complete accept gets the slot; others need a new link from the admin.

---

## Not part of invite-link onboarding

These routes use a different model (`league_players` with `pending` status) and are **not** used by `/join/{token}`:

- `GET /api/v1/leagues/league-player-requests`
- `POST /api/v1/leagues/accept-league-player-request`

Do not wire the invite deep link to those endpoints.

## Frontend checklist

### Admin (Manage → Players)

- [ ] Season picker + teams load before generate
- [ ] Flow A: user search → pick user → generate with `invitedUserId`
- [ ] Flow B: generate without `invitedUserId`
- [ ] Share `inviteLink` as-is (already a public `https://join.sportykore.com/join/{token}` URL)
- [ ] Native share
- [ ] Roster list + refetch after mutations

### Invitee (join link)

- [ ] Deep link `/join/:token` registered
- [ ] Token persisted across signup/login (AsyncStorage)
- [ ] After auth, always call `GET /invites/accept/:token`
- [ ] If `requiresProfile: true` → profile form → `POST complete-profile-and-accept`
- [ ] If `requiresProfile: false` → navigate to `leagueId`
- [ ] Clear stored token on success or hard failure
- [ ] Resume pending token on cold start
- [ ] Handle `403` / `404` / `409` with clear copy
